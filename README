Task is the following:

1) Reopen the Array class;
2) Rewrite the inject method.


The method will have to be renamed as RSPEC uses inject internally to perform le magic.

Inject (alias reduce) belongs to the enumerable mixin and enables the user to perform otherwise verbose operations in a few lines of code.
